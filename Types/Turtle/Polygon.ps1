.SYNOPSIS
    Draws a polygon
.DESCRIPTION
    Draws a regular polygon with N sides.

    To draw a closed polygon, provide a whole number of sides.

    To draw an open polygon, provide a fractial number of sides.
.EXAMPLE
    turtle polygon 42 3

# The default size of each segment of the polygon
[double]$Size = 42,
# The number of sides in the polygon.  
# If this is not a whole number, the polygon will not be closed.
[double]$SideCount = 6

# Determine the absolute side count
$absSideCount = [Math]::Abs($SideCount)
# and, for each whole number between 1 and that side count
$null = foreach ($n in 1..([Math]::Floor($absSideCount))) {
    # Rotate and move forward
    $this.Rotate(360 / $SideCount).Forward($Size)

# Determine if there was a remainder
$remainder = $SideCount - [Math]::Floor($SideCount)
# If there was not, return this polygon

# Otherwise, we do one more partial rotation (multiplied by the remainder)
# and draw one more line segment (multiplied by the remainder)
# (the effect will be like watching a polygon close)
