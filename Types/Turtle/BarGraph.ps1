.SYNOPSIS
    Draws a bar graph using turtle graphics.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script uses turtle graphics to draw a bar graph based on the provided data.
.EXAMPLE
    turtle barGraph 100 100 5 10 15 20 15 10 5
.EXAMPLE
    turtle barGraph 200 200 (
        @(1..50;-1..-50) | 
            Get-Random -Count (Get-Random -Minimum 5 -Maximum 20)
    ) save ./RandomBarGraph.svg
.EXAMPLE
    turtle rotate 90 barGraph 200 200 (
        @(1..50;-1..-50) | 
            Get-Random -Count (Get-Random -Minimum 5 -Maximum 20)
    ) save ./RandomVerticalBarGraph.svg
.EXAMPLE
    turtle rotate 45 barGraph 200 200 (
        @(1..50;-1..-50) | 
            Get-Random -Count (Get-Random -Minimum 5 -Maximum 20)
    ) save ./RandomDiagonalBarGraph.svg
.EXAMPLE
    $sourceData = @(1..50;-1..-50)
    $itemCount  = (Get-Random -Minimum 5 -Maximum 20) 
    $points     = $sourceData | Get-Random -Count $itemCount
    turtle bargraph 200 200 $points morph @(
        turtle bargraph 200 200 $points
        turtle bargraph 200 200 ( $sourceData | Get-Random -Count $itemCount )
        turtle bargraph 200 200 $points
    ) save ./RandomBarGraphMorph.svg
