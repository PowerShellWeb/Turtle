    .SYNOPSIS
        Gets Turtles
    .DESCRIPTION
        Gets turtles in a PowerShell.
    .NOTES
        Turtle Graphics are pretty groovy.
        
        They have been kicking it since 1966, and they are how computers first learned to draw.

        They kicked off the first computer-aided design boom and inspired generations of artists, engineers, mathematicians, and physicists.

        They are also _incredibly_ easy to build.

        A Turtle graphic is described with a series of moves.

        Let's start with the core three moves:
        
        Imagine you are a Turtle holding a pen.

        * You can turn `rotate`
        * You can move `forward`
        * You can lift the pen

        These are the three basic moves a turtle can make.
        
        We can describe more complex moves by combining these steps.

        Each argument can be the name of a move of the turtle object.

        After a member name is encountered, subsequent arguments will be passed to the member as parameters.
    .EXAMPLE
        # We can write shapes as a series of steps
        turtle "
            rotate 120
            forward 42 
            rotate 120 
            forward 42 
            rotate 120 
            forward 42
        "
    .EXAMPLE
        # We can also use a method.
        # Polygon will draw an an N-sided polygon.
        turtle polygon 10 5
    .EXAMPLE
        # A simple case of this is a square
        turtle square 42
    .EXAMPLE
        # If we rotate 45 degrees first, our square becomes a rhombus
        turtle rotate 45 square 42
    .EXAMPLE
        # We can draw a circle 
        turtle circle 10
    .EXAMPLE
        # Or a pair of half-circles
        turtle circle 10 0.5 rotate 90 circle 10 0.5
    .EXAMPLE
        # We can multiply arrays in PowerShell
        # this can make composing complex shapes easier.
        # Let's take the previous example and repeat it 8 times.
        turtle @('circle',42,0.5,'rotate',90 * 8)
    .EXAMPLE
        # Let's make a triangle by multiplying steps
        turtle ('forward', 10, 'rotate', 120 * 3)
    .EXAMPLE
        # Let's make a series of polygons, decreasing in size
        turtle polygon 10 6 polygon 10 5 polygon 10 4
    .EXAMPLE
        # We can also use a loop to produce a series of steps
        # Let's extend our previous example and make 9 polygons

                $n

        # This animates the path of the turtle.
        # If we want to morph a smaller shape into a bigger shape,
        # we can duplicate more lines
